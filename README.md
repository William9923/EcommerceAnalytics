<p align="center">A end to end data science project to learn about data engineering, data analysis and how machine learning can be used to solve the problem</b></p>

## Overview
This project is used as a method to learn more about data science workflow. From gathering needed data as data engineer, analyse what can be improved as data analyst and use machine learning as opportunities to automate certain task to improve our ecommerce system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EhdzxzMnBAIJyZU9aXpXrXs58gSnTMKU?usp=sharing) within this drive.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](scripts)
